                    Provisioning of IPv6 CPE devices
               draft-richardson-6man-cpe-provisioning-00

Abstract

   RFC7084 provides a series of IPv6 requirements for Customer Edge
   Routers.  It provides a multitude of possible configuration options
   without providing any mechanism by which the ISP side can determine
   what the needs of a given customer is.  This results in the ISP
   taking either too conservative (with a risk of too little resources),
   or a too liberal approach (with a resulting higher operational cost).

   This document describes a series of IP6CP and DHCPv6 options that
   allow CPE devices to inform an ISP as to what their current needs and
   capabilities are for IPv6 resources.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7084] provides a series of requirements for Customer Edge
   Devices.  These are generally referred to as Customer Premises Edge,
   or CPE-devices.

   [tr179] provides a guide for how to put another of protocols together
   in the PPPoE/DSL space, it does not provide a mechanism by which an
   ISP can determine what the actual requirements for a particular
   customer are.

   The result is that each CPE device has to make a series of requests,
   at each point attempting to acquire a bit more resources.  The ISP
   has to respond to each request in isolation without knowing whether
   or not the CPE device is done, or will come back for additional
   resources.

   There are significant optimizations, including significant security
   updates, that can be made if both parties are aware of the
   capabilities of the other party.  This document details the many
   options that have come to standardization, and explains what an
   optimal configuration is for a variety of different use cases.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [BCP14] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown
   here.

   This document does not yet make any requests for DHCPv6 or IP6CP
   options, but probably will.
