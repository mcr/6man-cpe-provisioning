                    Provisioning of IPv6 CPE devices
               draft-richardson-6man-cpe-provisioning-00

Abstract

   RFC7084 provides a series of IPv6 requirements for Customer Edge
   Routers.  It provides a multitude of possible configuration options
   without providing any mechanism by which the ISP side can determine
   what the needs of a given customer is.  This results in the ISP
   taking either too conservative (with a risk of too little resources),
   or a too liberal approach (with a resulting higher operational cost).

   This document describes a series of IP6CP and DHCPv6 options that
   allow CPE devices to inform an ISP as to what their current needs and
   capabilities are for IPv6 resources.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7084] provides a series of requirements for Customer Edge
   Devices.  These are generally referred to as Customer Premises Edge,
   or CPE-devices.

   [tr179] provides a guide for how to put another of protocols together
   in the PPPoE/DSL space, it does not provide a mechanism by which an
   ISP can determine what the actual requirements for a particular
   customer are.

   The result is that each CPE device has to make a series of requests,
   at each point attempting to acquire a bit more resources.  The ISP
   has to respond to each request in isolation without knowing whether
   or not the CPE device is done, or will come back for additional
   resources.

   There are significant optimizations, including significant security
   updates, that can be made if both parties are aware of the
   capabilities of the other party.  This document details the many
   options that have come to standardization, and explains what an
   optimal configuration is for a variety of different use cases.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [BCP14] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown
   here.

3.  Operational Options

   This section details how IPv6 prefixes are requested and used in
   typical CPE/ISP operations.

3.1.  IPv6 /64 for WAN link

   In parallel to the historical IPv4 configuration which featured a
   single PC attached to a cable or dialup network, the Customer
   Internet Connection (see [RFC7084] figure 1) is usually provided with
   an IPv6 prefix.

   [RFC7084] WAN-side requirements W-1, WAA-1, WAA-2, WAA-3, WAA-4, WAA-
   6, and WAA-7 essentially insist that the Customer Internet Connection
   be provisioned with some IPv6 address space, usually a /64.

   On older cable systems there may be a multitude of customers on this
   link, and the customers may be able to communicate with each other
   directly.  On more modern systems where there is FTTN or FTTH, all
   traffic is typically hairpined up to the ISP, and customers are
   isolated into seperate L2 domains.

   On PPP systems (PPPoE, DSL, LTE, and dialup), each customer has their
   own PPP link as an L2 domain.  Historical IPv4 mechanisms used proxy-
   ARP to map the end users onto a common L2 ethernet segment, but IPv6
   provides for a /64 per customer.

   The /64 is generally a lot of address space.  It provides for a CPE
   device to be able to use temporary adresses and other privacy
   preserving mechanism for communication from the CPE device itself.
   Many ask why the CPE device needs any additional address space, and
   why can't it just use some kind of proxy Neighbor Discovery.  (This
   document does not address that question, which has been rehashed in
   multiple WG mailing lists already).

   A bigger problem with /64 on point to point links is outlined by
   [RFC6164] is the ping-pong problem.  [I-D.palet-v6ops-p2p-links]
   section 3.3 discusses the use of unnumbered (IPv6 Link Local), noting
   that it is only possible when the device can otherwise use DHCPv6-PD
   ([RFC8415]) to get address space.

3.1.1.  SLAAC numbering of Customer Internet Connection

   The CPE MAY configure an address using either SLAAC [RFC4862] or
   [RFC7217] mechanisms.  The result is an address for the CPE to use on
   the Customer Internet Connection based upon PIO options in the Router
   Advertisements.

3.1.2.  DHCPv6 number of Customer Internet Connection

   The CPE MAY also make a DHCPv6 request for an address.

3.2.  IPv6 /64 for the device

   MUMBLE discusses the use of /64 per host.  In the case where the end
   system is a single PC or Smartphone this policy provides a number of
   advantages when temporary addresses are in use, over use of SLAAC
   over the Customer Internet Connection.

3.3.  IPv6 /64 per LAN port

   FOOBAZ argues that use of Layer-2 Bridging among home facing CPE
   ports (such as wired, and multiple frequencies of wireless) is
   undesirable.  [RFC7084] makes provision for this in requirement WPD-
   2.

3.4.  IPv6 /64 available for tethering

   While a Smartphone could live with a single /128 address, the
   arguments of Section 3.2 suggest that it will always have at least a
   /64.  If that /64 is present on the Customer Internet Connection,
   then it is hard to also use that prefix for tethering to another
   device over WiFi, Bluetooth, or Ethernet-over-USB connector.  This is
   commonly done today in IPv4 with extra layer of NAT44.  Another
   prefix is needed for the Smartphone to allow for tethering.

3.5.  DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation

   [RFC7084] in multiple requirements has the CPE device request a
   prefix from the ISP.  This larger prefix is then divided up into
   multiple /64 prefixes in order to satisfy some of the address
   requirements above.

3.6.  DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation exclusion

   The Customer Internet Connection MAY be numbered with Router
   Advertisements and DHCPv6 allocation from a prefix which is excluded
   using [RFC6603].  [RFC6603] section 4.1 explains how the Requesting
   Router can indicate support (in DHCPv6) for this option.

   If the Customer Internet Connection is numbered only via DHCPv6 (and
   never via Router Advertisement), then it is possible to deploy this
   to both CPE systems that understand this exclusion option, and those
   that do not.

4.  Operational Use cases

   makes use of the operational options above.

4.2.  Simple Residential Network

4.3.  Complex Residential Network
